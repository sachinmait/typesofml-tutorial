# Types of ML Tutorial

A comprehensive guide to Machine Learning algorithms and techniques, with interactive examples and detailed explanations.

## Overview

This tutorial covers various types of Machine Learning algorithms, with a focus on Reinforcement Learning methods. Each algorithm is explained with its core concepts, use cases, and practical applications.

## Reinforcement Learning Methods

### Q-Learning

**Overview**: Q-Learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the optimal action-value function for a given state.

**Key Features**:
- Learns optimal actions for each state using a value table
- Model-free: doesn't require knowledge of the environment's dynamics
- Off-policy: can learn from actions taken by other policies
- Uses the Bellman equation to update Q-values iteratively

**Use Case**: Simple environments with discrete states
- Grid worlds and maze navigation
- Simple game environments with finite state spaces
- Problems where the state space is small enough for tabular representation

**Algorithm**: Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[r + γ max Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]

### Deep Q-Networks (DQN)

**Overview**: DQN extends Q-Learning by using deep neural networks to approximate Q-values, enabling learning in high-dimensional state spaces.

**Key Features**:
- Uses neural networks to approximate Q-values for complex environments
- Experience replay buffer to break correlation between consecutive samples
- Target network for stable learning
- Handles high-dimensional state spaces (e.g., raw pixels)

**Use Case**: Complex environments like video games
- Atari games with pixel-based observations
- Complex control tasks with continuous state spaces
- Environments where tabular Q-learning is impractical

**Innovations**: Experience replay, target networks, and epsilon-greedy exploration

### Policy Gradient

**Overview**: Policy Gradient methods directly optimize the policy function that maps states to actions, rather than learning value functions.

**Key Features**:
- Directly learns the policy for taking actions
- Can handle continuous action spaces naturally
- Uses gradient ascent to maximize expected rewards
- Stochastic policies enable exploration

**Use Case**: Continuous action spaces
- Robotic control with continuous joint movements
- Autonomous driving with steering and acceleration control
- Financial trading with continuous position sizing

**Algorithm**: θ ← θ + α∇J(θ), where J(θ) is the expected reward

### Actor-Critic

**Overview**: Actor-Critic methods combine the benefits of both value-based and policy-based approaches by maintaining both a policy (actor) and a value function (critic).

**Key Features**:
- Combines value-based and policy-based methods
- Actor: learns the policy (what action to take)
- Critic: learns the value function (how good the current state is)
- Reduces variance compared to pure policy gradient methods

**Use Case**: Balancing exploration and exploitation
- Complex control tasks requiring both exploration and exploitation
- Environments with large state and action spaces
- Applications requiring stable and efficient learning

**Advantages**: Lower variance than policy gradient, more stable than pure value methods
